# Identification-of-hydrodynamic-instability
Identification of hydrodynamic instability by convolutional neural networks

Note that you need to install Pytorch machine learning library, NumPy, Matplotlib and other libraries before running. Please see the website https://pytorch.org/ , https://numpy.org/ and https://matplotlib.org/ for the installation steps and documentation. 

This code implement the identification of hydrodynamic instability by CNN framework and reveals the key spatial features for classification of different flow patterns by principal component analysis.
